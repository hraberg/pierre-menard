# Pierre Menard

*There is no exercise of the intellect which is not, in the final analysis, useless.*
  -- "Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote", Jorge Luis Borges


Pierre Menard started as an attempt to implement Hierarchical Temporal Memory Cortical Learning Algorithms, as described in the [Numenta](http://www.numenta.com/) [whitepaper](https://www.numenta.com/htm-overview/education/HTM_CorticalLearningAlgorithms.pdf) (Version 0.2.1, September 12, 2011) in Clojure after seeing Jeff Hawkins speak at [Strange Loop 2012](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Brain-Computing).

Now, this isn't what Pierre Menard is. Instead I've been spending a few weeks reading up on the background around various "cognitive" systems. To be frank, I was treading water a bit - I was bouncing back and forth between paper after paper in Answer Set Programming, Functional Logic Programming, Co-Inductive Logic Programming, and started slowly feel that I was missing the big picture.

So I needed some new inspiration, and Jeff Hawkins' keynote did set me down this road, which initially was pretty humble, just trying to understand the pseudo code in the Numenta whitepaper, but I realized I needed a better, both technical and critical, understanding of the different pieces here.

There are many interesting papers and thoughts out there, but they take time to analyze and consolidate into a working model of software. One key is to program and compose emergent behavior - I don't know exactly how to describe what I mean here, but we'll know it when we see it. Another key is to get the computer to help us on the way - to explain what its doing and why, and suggest alternatives. These two aren't necessarily dependent on each other. A third key is potentially continental philosophy - this is not so much to provide answers, but to help detect shortcuts - both to take and avoid.

And I'm finally starting to see overlap between the references in De Landa "Philosophy and Simulation" (2011) and papers I currently read, but arrived to at from a different angle. There's a pattern here somewhere, and, to paraphrase Jeff: "I have a feeling its going to be important". Potentially what is needed is a book describing the ideas and findings - again, taking cue from Jeff - "On Intelligence" (2004) is a book that calls for of action, not one that has all the answers.

Pierre Menard is a scratch pad, its nothing really, and it is where it eventually will happen. It's not a new rule engine, language or an IDE, its a creation of a concept, similar to what was and is, but also, what is yet to be.

And "what about Deuce?" - I will keep working on Deuce, it is a totally different form of programming, it needs a different type of problem solving, more engineering and heavy lifting, and less theoretical thinking. I plan to work on both Pierre Menard and Deuce for at least 2013.
